This is the crucial practical side of the project. Since money and league standings are on the line, reliability is paramount. You cannot have a racer disconnect or have their stream freeze in the middle of a "Grand Prix."
Because Mario Kart Tour is a mobile game, the setup is slightly more complex than just streaming a PC game. The racer needs to get the video signal out of their phone and into a broadcasting computer.
Here is the definitive guide to the external setup required for a Cozy-Kart racer.
The "Cozy-Kart Certified" Racer Setup
We recommend a Hardware-Based Capture setup. This provides the lowest latency and highest reliability. While software mirroring (like AirPlay to PC) exists, it is often too laggy for competitive racing.
Below is the standard kit a racer needs.
1. The Source Device (Mobile Phone)
They need a device powerful enough to run Mario Kart Tour smoothly while outputting a video signal.
 * Requirement: A modern iPhone (iPhone X or newer recommended) or a high-end Android phone (Samsung S-series, Pixel, etc.).
 * Why: Budget phones may stutter when trying to play and output HDMI simultaneously.
2. The Bridge (The Adapters)
This is the most critical link in the chain. They need to convert their phone's charging port into an HDMI video port.
 * For iPhone (Lightning): Apple Lightning Digital AV Adapter. (Do not buy cheap knockoffs; they often fail during long streams.)
 * For newer iPhone (15+) / Android (USB-C): A high-quality USB-C to HDMI Hub which also has a power pass-through port so the phone can charge while streaming.
3. The Capture Hardware (The Capture Card)
This device takes the HDMI signal from the phone adapter and feeds it into the computer as if it were a webcam.
 * The Gold Standard: Elgato Cam Link 4K or Elgato HD60 X.
 * The Budget Option: Generic "HDMI Video Capture USB dongles" (often found on Amazon for ~$20). These work surprisingly well for 720p streaming but may have slight color compression.
4. The Broadcast Computer (PC or Mac)
The phone runs the game; the computer handles the heavy lifting of encoding the video and sending it to Twitch.
 * Requirement: A reasonably modern laptop or desktop (e.g., Intel i5 / AMD Ryzen 5 processor or better, released in the last 4-5 years).
 * Software: OBS Studio (Open Broadcaster Software). It is free, industry-standard, and allows them to compose their scene (game feed + maybe a small camera facecam).
5. Audio Gear & Internet
 * Headphones: Essential. The racer must wear headphones so their microphone doesn't pick up the game audio from speakers, causing an echo loop on the stream.
 * Internet: A stable Wi-Fi connection (5GHz band) near the router, or ideally, an Ethernet adapter for their PC. They need at least 5 Mbps upload speed for a stable 720p stream.

Here is how all these external pieces connect physically on the racer's desk.
Summary Checklist for a New Racer
Before a racer is allowed to join the "Founding Grid," they should confirm they have:
 * [ ] A Twitch Account (where they will stream to).
 * [ ] A Discord Account (to join the queue).
 * [ ] Mario Kart Tour installed on a capable phone.
 * [ ] The correct HDMI adapter for their phone.
 * [ ] A capture card connecting their phone to their PC.
 * [ ] OBS Studio installed and configured to stream to their Twitch channel.
