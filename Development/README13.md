The user experience isn't complete without the "After-Action Report" (Analytics).
In a high-intensity esport, this would be a high-tech screen full of histograms and aggressive bar charts. But for the Cozy-Kart League, we want to encourage players even if they lost.
So, the next diagram is "The Race Log".
This functions as the post-game statistical breakdown, but it is visualized as a Scrapbook or Journal Entry.
 * Lap Times: Drawn as hand-written notes in the margins.
 * Performance Graph: A line graph that looks like it was drawn with a marker or Washi tape, showing their position throughout the race.
 * Highlights: "Polaroid" snapshots of their best moments (e.g., "Nice Drift!", "Close Call!") clipped onto the page.
It turns cold, hard data into a nostalgic memory, keeping the vibes immaculate even after a loss.
